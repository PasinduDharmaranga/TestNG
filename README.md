Generating a Unit Test Report

You generate a Maven unit test report (Surefire unit test report) using the following Maven command:

mvn surefire-report:report

The generated unit test report can be found in the target/site directory. The unit test report is named surefire-report.html. The path to the unit test report is thus:

your-project/target/site/surefire-report.html
